## Question 1

Alan Turing’s paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, presents the famous Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence. In it, he preemptively addresses several objections to the idea that machines could think, providing counterarguments to each. However, more than seventy years later, some of these objections still carry weight, while new concerns have emerged due to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). 
Several objections to machine intelligence that Turing discusses remain relevant today. One of the strongest is the Argument from Consciousness, which asserts that machines may simulate intelligence but lack emotions like empathy,care ,understanding regarding certain topics.. While AI systems like LLM models  and other advanced models like siri or alexa can generate human-like responses and texts even solve the questions and maye answer mental health related questions, they do not possess emotions, self-reflection, or a sense of self. This objection remains significant because human intelligence is deeply tied to consciousness, and mimicking human behavior is not the same as genuinely thinking, experiencing or feeling it.Moreover, another  enduring objection is Lady Lovelace’s Objection, which argues that machines can only do what they are programmed to do and cannot exhibit true creativity or original thought. While AI has shown impressive capabilities in generating art, music, generating images, and even scientific hypotheses, these outputs are still based on patterns in existing data rather than original thinking . Turing countered this by suggesting that machines could learn in ways similar to human children by experiences and eing trained on data, but whether learning algorithms equate to genuine creative thinking remains an open debate.
Turing’s rarguemnts were progressive, but still debatable. His response to the Argument from Consciousness was that if we accept other humans as independent thinkers based on their experiences and behaviour we should also apply the same principles to machines. This, however, is predicated on the idea that behaviour alone proves thought which weakens the validity of his argument.Turing’s response to Lady Lovelace’s Objection was that machines could be programmed to learn and adapt, making their actions unpredictable even to their creators. While this prediction is remarkably prescient given today’s machine learning advancements, AI still lacks independent reasoning beyond its training data.
Since Turing’s time, new concerns have emerged. One major objection being  the Ethical and Social Implications of AI, including bias, misinformation, and the potential for AI to be used in harmful and deceitful ways making the users vulneravle to cyber threats. AI systems inherit biases from their training data, leading to ethical concerns about fairness, discrimination, misinformation and the way the data was collected including the privacy of users being at stake.. Turing did not foresee the scale of these ethical dilemmas, making them an important issue.Another modern challenge is the inability to fully understand how complex AI models arrive at their decisions, cloning and replicating on their own. Unlike human reasoning, which can be introspectively examined, advanced neural networks operate in ways that are difficult for even their creators to interpret. This raises concerns about accountability and trust in AI decision-making.
Turing predicted that by the year 2000, a machine would have a 30% chance of fooling an unskilled interrogator in a five-minute Turing Test. This prediction was somewhat optimisti and showed his progressive thinking mindset . It wasn’t until the 2014 Loebner Prize that the chatbot “Eugene Goostman” reportedly passed the Turing Test by convincing 33% of judges that it was human. However, even this result was controversial, as Eugene relied on tricks such as pretending to be a non-native English speaker rather than truly demonstrating intelligence.In 2024, AI chatbots like ChatGPT and other large language models have come closer to passing extended Turing Tests, but their reliance on statistical pattern-matching rather than true understanding means they are still distinguishable from humans under careful scrutiny. Turing’s prediction was reasonable in spirit—AI did achieve conversational fluency—but his estimated timeline was somewhat premature.
Some objections, which concern consciousness and creativity, are not entirely resolved, while those that say machines can never learn have been largely overcome. New concerns are rising, in contrast to those Turing could not foresee, especially about ethics, bias, and the interpretability of AI. Although the prediction about passing the Turing Test was not at all realized by 2000, today's AI systems seem to get close. Turing's work continues, in the end, to shape discussions not only about artificial intelligence but also about the very nature of machine cognition.
